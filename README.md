<h1>Pathfinder - finding the shortest path between given cities.</h1>
<p>This is implementation of <b>the Floyd-Warshall algorithm</b>.</p>
<p>In computer science, the <b>Floyd–Warshall algorithm</b> (also known as Floyd's algorithm, the Roy–Warshall algorithm, the Roy–Floyd algorithm, or the WFI algorithm) is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).</p>
