<h1>Pathfinder - finding the shortest path between given cities.</h1>
<p>This is implementation of <b>the Floyd-Warshall algorithm</b>.</p>
<p>In computer science, the <b>Floyd–Warshall algorithm</b> (also known as Floyd's algorithm, the Roy–Warshall algorithm, the Roy–Floyd algorithm, or the WFI algorithm) is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).</p>
<p>For more details <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm">Wiki</a>.</p>
<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>First you need to <b>compile</b> the project. Just write <em><b>make</b></em> in root directory. After compilation <b>pathfinder</b> file appears in root directory.</li>
    <li>To test program you can use my default example(contained in root directory). Write <b>./pathfinder example</b></li>
    <li>If you want to use your own data, you should create file with the same syntax as in <b>example</b> file.</li>
</ul>
