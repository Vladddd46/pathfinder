<h1>Pathfinder - finding the shortest path between given cities.</h1>
<p>This is implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.</p>
<p>In computer science, the Floyd–Warshall algorithm (also known as Floyd's algorithm, the Roy–Warshall algorithm, the Roy–Floyd algorithm, or the WFI algorithm) is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).</p>
